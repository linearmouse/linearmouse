## Contributing localizations

You may submit localizations by using [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/linearmouse), or editing `LinearMouse/[lang].lproj/Localizable.strings` directly.

To add a new localization, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/linearmouse/linearmouse/issues/new) with the target language you want to contribute, and I'll initialize the localization directory.
